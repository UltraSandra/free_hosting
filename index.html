        <p>
            A <span style="font-weight:bold">web hosting service</span> is a type of Internet hosting service that
            allows individuals and organizations to
            make their website accessible via the World Wide Web. Web hosts are companies that provide space on a
            server owned or leased for use by clients, as well as providing Internet connectivity, typically in a data
            center. Web hosts can also provide data center space and connectivity to the Internet for other servers
            located in their data center, called colocation, also known as Housing in Latin America or France.
        </p>

            <dt>
                <h3> Small hosting services</h3>
            </dt>


            <dd>The most basic is web page and small-scale file hosting, where files can be uploaded via File Transfer
                Protocol (FTP) or a Web interface. The files are usually delivered to the Web "as is" or with minimal
                processing. Many Internet service providers (ISPs) offer this service free to subscribers. Individuals
                and organizations may also obtain Web page hosting from alternative service providers.
                <br>

                Free web hosting service is offered by different companies with limited services, sometimes supported
                by advertisements, and often limited when compared to paid hosting.
                <br>
                Single page hosting is generally sufficient for personal web pages. Personal web site hosting is
                typically free, advertisement-sponsored, or inexpensive. Business web site hosting often has a higher
                expense depending upon the size and type of the site.</dd>




            <dt>
                <h3>Larger hosting services</h3>
            </dt>

            <dd>Many large companies that are not Internet service providers need to be permanently connected to the
                web to send email, files, etc. to other sites. The company may use the computer as a website host to
                provide details of their goods and services and facilities for online orders.
                <br>
                A complex site calls for a more comprehensive package that provides database support and application
                development platforms (e.g. ASP.NET, ColdFusion, Java EE, Perl/Plack, PHP or Ruby on Rails). These
                facilities allow customers to write or install scripts for applications like forums and content
                management. Also, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is typically used for websites that wish to keep the data
                transmitted more secure.</dd>

            <p>
                A strong, browser-based website builder, Wix.com reigns supreme if you want a simple, drag-and-drop
                interface for building basic sites (i.e., for portfolios, small sites, etc.).
                <br>
                While it’s not for those who are looking to work out their coding skills, house various video files, or
                host an app they’ve been tinkering with (If you match these descriptions, read on!), Wix leads the way
                when it comes to easy setup and robust features.
                <br>
                Note that advanced email, domain, and eCommerce features are available from Wix by upgrading to its
                non-free plans. Their support isn’t always great, but it almost doesn’t matter. We find Wix.com’s
                offering to be ideal for beginner site owners:

            <p>
                One of the most well-known brands when it comes to getting online, WordPress powers 30% of all
                websites. The open-source version of the content management requires site owners to purchase and
                configure a web hosting plan, but WordPress.com removes all that hassle by pairing the popular system
                with plenty of online storage and support.
                <br>
                The biggest knock on WordPress is that it’s not as simple as some of the drag-and-drop site builders
                such as Wix and Weebly. But with hundreds of themes and customization options to choose from, WordPress
                gives users an extraordinarily high ceiling with which to create and grow an online presence.
